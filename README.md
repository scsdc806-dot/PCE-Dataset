:blush: At present, no large-scale paired dataset for underwater color polarization imaging exists.

:blue_heart:The collection of such paired datasets is highly complex and challenging, as each group of paired images with different concentrations requires a complete water replacement in the experimental tank and approximately 200 rounds of image calibration.

:tada: This makes the acquisition process extremely costly. The introduction of the PCE-Dataset itself fills this gap by providing the first large-scale paired dataset for underwater color polarization training.

:basketball: We also plan to release this dataset as open source once further progress is made in our research.
